# HR_ANALYTICS_DASHBOARD
Attrition Distribution by Age:
The dashboard shows that the highest attrition is in the 26-35 age group, with 111 employees leaving. This suggests that young to mid-career professionals are more likely to leave the company, which could indicate issues with career growth opportunities or work-life balance for this demographic.

Education-Based Attrition:
The largest proportion of attrition (38.26%) comes from employees with a background in Medical sciences, followed by Life Sciences (24.78%). This might indicate that the company is struggling to retain employees with specialized scientific backgrounds, possibly due to competitive job markets in these fields.

Job Role Analysis:
Laboratory Technicians, Sales Executives, and Research Scientists show the highest attrition numbers (60, 56, and 44 respectively). This suggests that these roles may need special attention in terms of retention strategies, possibly including reassessing compensation packages, career development opportunities, or work conditions.

Gender-Based Insights:
While specific numbers aren't provided, the dashboard includes a section on "Attrition By Age" split between Male and Female. This indicates that the company is tracking gender-based attrition, which is crucial for ensuring equal opportunities and addressing any potential gender-specific issues in the workplace.

Years at Company Impact:
The "Attrition By Years At Company" chart shows a trend where attrition seems to peak early in an employee's tenure (likely in the first few years) and then decreases over time. This could suggest that the company needs to focus on better onboarding and early-career support to improve retention of newer employees.
